              I led research for a Microsoft Teams feature aimed at improving meeting concentration, discovering a 15% boost in focus. Additionally, I developed a C++ MFC-based Windows application to address incident reports during Teams calls, incorporating a recommendation algorithm that allowed clients to self-diagnose and resolve issues, potentially reducing company resource costs by 20%. I also wrote product specifications and design documents to outline our workflow and ensure alignment with industry standards.

              I instructed over 15 K-12 students in the fundamentals of Arduino computing, guiding them through hands-on projects using sensors, lightbulbs, and keypads within Arduinoâ€™s IDE. I also revamped the course curriculum by brainstorming new ideas and implementing over 1,000 lines of code to create mini-exercises and a final project that helped students apply their knowledge in a practical, engaging way.

                I assisted over 25 eighth-grade students in a Python-focused curriculum, answering their questions and fostering their enthusiasm for programming. I also led makeup sessions, providing one-on-one instruction to students who missed regular classes. Through personalized guidance, I achieved a 100% success rate in helping them catch up and seamlessly rejoin the main curriculum.

                I developed a robust API for the MyPlan website, focusing on managing user course history and current enrollment data. By leveraging Express.js, I built a backend that efficiently processes and retrieves information from an SQLite database, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience. I crafted complex SQL queries to aggregate and present course information, empowering users to easily track their academic progress. Working collaboratively with a friend, we prioritized code quality, performance, and security, ensuring the project met all technical requirements. This experience significantly enhanced my skills in backend development, database management, and API design.

                This project served as my introductory in web development. I chose something to build the was simple yet complex enough for me to learn from. <br><br> This project is a JavaScript-based Pong game with both single-player and two-player modes. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features smooth paddle controls, dynamic ball movement, and real-time gameplay updates. Players can choose between competing against an AI or another player, with collision detection and ball physics adding complexity. The game includes a start screen, pause, and reset functionality, providing an engaging and responsive experience.
